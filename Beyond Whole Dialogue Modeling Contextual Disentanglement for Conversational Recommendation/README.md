## BEYOND WHOLE DIALOGUE MODELING: CONTEXTUAL DISENTANGLEMENT FOR CONVERSATIONAL RECOMMENDATION
https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3726302.3729903

### **1. What's the problem?**

In conversational recommendation systems (CRS), the goal is to help users find what they want (like recommending a movie) based on a dialogue between the user and the system. Earlier methods often focus only on specific entities (like a movie or an actor) mentioned by the user. However, this approach can miss the bigger picture: sometimes, users provide useful background context that isn't tied to an entity—for example, _why_ they're watching (say, "with my girlfriend") or their mood. If we ignore this, we can misunderstand what the user really wants and give poor recommendations.

### **2. Why is context so tricky?**

Conversation context is messy: it mixes information _about entities_ (intentions and interests directly related to specific items) with more general _background information_ (circumstances, mood, people involved, etc.). Past methods treated all context as equally important, which prevents the system from understanding what really matters to the user's intent. For example, if a user says they want to watch a movie with their girlfriend and likes Tom Hanks, previous methods might recommend any Tom Hanks movie—even if the background (like wanting a romantic movie) suggests something else would be more appropriate 3726302.3729903.pdf.

### **3. What's our proposed solution?**

We propose a **disentanglement approach**—basically, we first separate the conversation's _focus information_ (entity-related, e.g., "Tom Hanks," "comedy") from the _background information_ (non-entity, e.g., "with my girlfriend"), then dynamically balance these two according to context. This allows us to better identify the user's main intent and filter out irrelevant details. For instance, our method might decide "La La Land" is a better suggestion than "Cast Away" for the scenario in the example, since it considers the importance of watching a movie with a significant other 3726302.3729903.pdf.

### **4. How do we implement this separation?**

We introduce two self-supervised methods to do this:

- **Contrastive Disentanglement (CD):** We make the representations of focus and background information as different as possible in the model's internal "space." We use known entity mentions as "proxies"—so, the model is trained to ensure that focus information is closer to these proxy entities, and background is farther apart. This helps the model learn what text is about the focus and what's just background 3726302.3729903.pdf.
    
- **Counterfactual Inference Disentanglement (CID):** This borrows a concept from "what-if" reasoning. For each recommendation, we ask: if we removed focus or background information, how would the recommendation change? We then check which type of information (focus or background) explains the user's choice more. This gives the model signals for how to separate out the two types of information 3726302.3729903.pdf.
    

### **5. How do we use the separated information?**

Simply splitting focus and background isn't enough—we need to _combine_ them in a smart way for recommendation. So, we introduce an **adaptive prompt learning module:**

- We build a "prompt pool"—combinations of focus and background information with the overall context.
- A "prompt selector" (essentially a small neural network) then dynamically chooses the right mix (prompt) for each user dialogue, weighting focus or background higher depending on the context 3726302.3729903.pdf.

### **6. Does this really work?**

Yes! We compared our method—called DisenCRS—with versions that only use focus or background, or that combine them using fixed weights. The full adaptive version works best. Using only focus or background loses key insights; fixed weights aren't flexible enough. Our adaptive module dynamically finds the best combination for each conversation, leading to better recommendations 3726302.3729903.pdf.

We also find that the number of prompt combinations in the "prompt pool" matters. Too few, and the model lacks flexibility; too many, and the model gets confused—so there's a sweet spot 3726302.3729903.pdf.

### **7. Summary:**

Imagine you tell a friend you want to watch a movie, you liked Tom Hanks' movies, but also that you want to watch _with your girlfriend_. If your friend only pays attention to the "Tom Hanks" part, you'll get a movie you might like but maybe not one that fits your romantic mood. Our system first figures out _what_ in your message is about movies and actors, and _what_ is about the situation, then smartly decides which kind of information matters more in picking a suggestion. It learns this by comparing lots of conversations and checking which parts mattered most in people's actual choices. As a result, our recommendations better fit what you _really_ want
