# Data-efficient Meta-models for Evaluation of Context-based Questions and Answers in LLMs

## Feynman Explanation

*As if I were the author explaining my own work:*

Think of hallucination detection like having a **lie detector for AI systems**. When an AI answers a question, it might make up plausible-sounding information not supported by the given context. This system detects such fabrications.

### Two-Stage Pipeline

1. **Feature Extraction**: An "extractor LLM" pulls out internal representations
2. **Meta-Classification**: Lightweight classifiers make final predictions

### Feature Extraction Methods

**Pooling-based Features:**
- Mean pooling (averaging all tokens)
- Max pooling (taking maximum values)
- Last token extraction

**Lookback Lens Features:** Attention weight ratios between context and generated tokens

### Mathematical Formulation

**Lookback Ratio:**
```
Lookback ratio = mean attention weight between context and generated tokens across all layers/heads
```

For efficiency, they use PCA/UMAP to compress features to 30 components each (staying under TabPFNv2's 500-feature limit).

## Technical Deep Dive

### The Hallucination Detection Challenge

**Problem**: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate plausible-sounding but factually incorrect information not supported by the given context.

**Solution**: A two-stage system that:
1. Extracts internal model representations during generation
2. Uses lightweight classifiers to detect hallucinations

### Feature Extraction Architecture

**Stage 1: Internal Representation Extraction**

**Pooling-Based Features:**
- **Mean Pooling**: Average activation across all tokens
- **Max Pooling**: Maximum activation values
- **Last Token**: Final token representation
- **Rationale**: Captures different aspects of model's internal state

**Lookback Lens Features:**
- **Attention Analysis**: How much the model attends to context vs. generated content
- **Cross-Layer Aggregation**: Combines attention patterns across all transformer layers
- **Mathematical Definition**: 
  ```
  Lookback_score = Σ(attention_weight_context) / Σ(attention_weight_all)
  ```

**Stage 2: Dimensionality Reduction**
- **PCA/UMAP**: Compress to 30 components per feature type
- **Efficiency Constraint**: TabPFNv2 limit of 500 total features
- **Information Preservation**: Maintains discriminative power while reducing complexity

### Meta-Classification Strategy

**TabPFNv2 Classifier:**
- **Data Efficiency**: Excels with minimal training data
- **Performance**: Achieves 0.7834 ROC-AUC
- **Optimization**: Requires only 250 samples for peak performance

**Why Meta-Models?**
- **Transferability**: Learns general hallucination patterns
- **Efficiency**: Avoids fine-tuning large models
- **Interpretability**: Provides clear decision boundaries
