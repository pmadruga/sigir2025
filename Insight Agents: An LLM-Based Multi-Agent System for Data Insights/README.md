# Insight Agents: An LLM-Based Multi-Agent System for Data Insights

## Feynman Explanation

*As if I were the author explaining my own work:*

Think of e-commerce sellers as **restaurant owners with sophisticated kitchen tools** they don't know how to use. Insight Agents is like having a skilled chef (AI system) who uses all tools to create personalized dishes (insights).

### Hierarchical Three-Tier Structure

1. **Manager Agent** (Head Chef): Central coordinator with OOD detection and routing
2. **Data Presentation Agent** (Prep Chef): Handles data retrieval and formatting
3. **Insight Generation Agent** (Sous Chef): Creates personalized business insights

## Technical Deep Dive

### Query Understanding Challenges

**Complex E-commerce Environment:**
- Complex e-commerce queries with multiple intents
- Sellers struggle discovering available programs/tools
- Difficulty utilizing rich data from various sources
- Need for automated retrieval with personalized insights

**Example Query Complexity:**
"Show me my bestselling products last month and suggest which advertising programs might help boost sales for my underperforming items in the electronics category."

This single query requires:
- Data retrieval (sales analytics)
- Performance analysis (bestselling vs. underperforming)
- Category filtering (electronics)
- Program recommendation (advertising options)
- Personalization (seller-specific context)

### Multi-Agent Architecture

**Manager Agent (Orchestrator):**
- **OOD Detection**: Identifies out-of-domain queries using lightweight encoder-decoder
- **Query Classification**: BERT-based classifier determines query type
- **Agent Routing**: Directs queries to appropriate specialized agents

**Data Presentation Agent:**
- **Data Retrieval**: Interfaces with multiple Amazon data sources
- **Format Standardization**: Normalizes data from different systems
- **Context Enrichment**: Adds relevant metadata and historical context
- **Visualization Preparation**: Formats data for human consumption

**Insight Generation Agent:**
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies trends and anomalies in seller data
- **Personalization Engine**: Tailors insights to specific seller characteristics
- **Recommendation System**: Suggests actionable business strategies
- **Natural Language Generation**: Creates human-readable insights
