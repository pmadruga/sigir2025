## PROACTIVE CONVERSATIONAL AI: A COMPREHENSIVE SURVEY OF ADVANCEMENTS AND OPPORTUNITIES
https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3715097

### 1. **What's this paper about in simple terms?**

In this paper, we examine how conversational AI systems (the technology behind chatbots and voice assistants) can become more proactive, rather than just reacting to user instructions. This means, instead of always waiting for a user to say something, the AI figures out when to take the lead—anticipating needs, asking questions, shifting topics, or suggesting actions that benefit the conversation or the user in the long term.

### 2. **Why does this matter?**

Most dialogue systems today are reactive: you say something, they answer. This works for many situations, but it means they often can't help you as well as a human could. For example, a human assistant might notice you're frustrated and offer emotional support without being asked or suggest a more efficient solution to your problem before you even know there is one. Introducing proactivity can make dialogue systems more helpful, engaging, and capable of complex interactions, leading us closer to true intelligent assistants.

### 3. **What are the key ideas and definitions?**

We define a proactive dialogue system as one that can plan conversations to achieve goals by taking initiative and anticipating future outcomes, rather than just following what the user wants every time. This definition has three main elements:

- **Anticipation**: The AI tries to predict or plan for future goals or outcomes—like keeping a conversation interesting, making you happy, or completing a task efficiently.
- **Initiative**: The AI chooses the right moment to take action, like changing topics, asking about your preferences, or providing suggestions.
- **Planning**: The AI must organize its actions and conversation flow strategically to achieve the intended goals.

### 4. **What types of dialogue systems do we discuss?**

We categorize dialogue systems into three main types, because proactivity can look different in each:

- **Open-Domain Dialogue Systems (ODDs):** These are chatbots that talk with users about a wide range of topics (think social chatbots). Here, proactivity might involve bringing up new, relevant topics or showing empathy without being prompted.
- **Task-Oriented Dialogue Systems (TODs):** These systems help users complete specific tasks, like booking tickets. Proactivity could mean suggesting better alternatives or asking clarifying questions before a problem arises.
- **Conversational Information-Seeking Systems (CIS):** These systems, such as conversational search engines or recommendation bots, help you find information. Proactivity may mean suggesting follow-up questions, clarifying vague requests, or proactively surfacing information before you ask.

### 5. **How do we study and evaluate proactivity?**

Evaluating proactive systems is more complex than assessing reactive systems because we must consider not only if the AI responds well, but also if it anticipates user needs appropriately and ethically. It involves psychology and sociology since human-AI interactions are nuanced. We discuss the importance of robust evaluation metrics and the ethical considerations, like ensuring that taking initiative does not harm or annoy the user.

### 6. **What's new in our survey?**

Unlike previous surveys, which mostly focus on reactive dialogue systems, we:

- Provide a clearer, three-part definition of proactivity.
- Refine the taxonomy of proactive problems and offer concrete examples in each type of system.
- Include discussions on emotional support, system-initiated sub-dialogues, and over-specified queries in information-seeking dialogues.
- Analyze the role of large language models (like GPT-3 and beyond) in enabling proactive behaviors.
- Add a maintained list of up-to-date resources for ongoing research in the field.

### 7. **What are the main challenges and future directions?**

There are several open challenges: balancing the benefits and risks of proactivity (as it could be intrusive), building robust evaluation protocols, and developing technical capabilities to support genuine initiative. We also point towards future trends, like integrating larger language models and exploring more advanced planning and reasoning abilities in dialogue systems 3715097.pdf.

### **In summary:**

- Most current AI dialogue systems only respond to what users say.
- Proactive systems aim to take initiative by anticipating, planning, and guiding conversations.
- We provide an in-depth survey that covers the current state, challenges, evaluation, and future directions for making conversational AI more proactive.
- Our work bridges past and emerging research, focusing on the evolution driven by large language models and ethical design
