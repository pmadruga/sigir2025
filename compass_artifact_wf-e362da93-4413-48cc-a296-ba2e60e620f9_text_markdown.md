## 1. A Reproducibility Study of Graph-Based Legal Case Retrieval

### Main Institution
**University of Essex** - Authors: Gregor Donabauer and Udo Kruschwitz

### Feynman Explanation

Imagine you're a lawyer who needs to find similar legal cases to support your argument. Instead of reading thousands of cases manually, this system creates a **smart network of legal documents** - like a social network, but for legal cases.

**The Core Concept - Graph Networks:**
Think of each legal case and legal charge as dots (nodes) on a massive map. These dots are connected by lines (edges) that show relationships:
- **Case-to-case connections**: When cases reference each other or share similar facts
- **Charge-to-charge connections**: When legal violations often appear together (like theft and breaking-and-entering)
- **Case-to-charge connections**: When a specific case involves certain charges

**The Mathematical Foundation:**
The system represents this network as G = (V, E) where:
- V = all nodes (cases + charges)
- E = all edges (relationships)

**The Learning Process:**
The system learns using a **contrastive loss function**:
```
L = L_contrastive + λ × L_regularization
```

This is like teaching a dog to fetch - you reward it for bringing back the right ball (similar cases) and discourage it from bringing random objects (dissimilar cases).

**The Processing Pipeline:**
1. **PromptCase Stage**: Takes raw legal text and creates three versions:
   - Original full text
   - 50-word summary of facts (using GPT-3.5)
   - Key legal issues extracted

2. **CaseGNN Stage**: Converts text into structured graphs using Graph Attention Networks (GAT)
   - Each layer aggregates information from neighboring nodes
   - Uses attention mechanisms to weight importance

3. **CaseLink Stage**: Builds the final network using:
   - BM25 scores for case similarity (like Google's text matching)
   - Cosine similarity for charge relationships
   - Direct text matching for case-charge connections

4. **Final Scoring**: 
```
Relevance Score = similarity(query_case_embedding, candidate_case_embedding)
```

**The Reproducibility Challenge:**
The authors tried to recreate the original CaseLink system but found **significant performance drops**:
- COLIEE 2022: 5.4-7.2 point drop
- COLIEE 2023: 3.8-11.7 point drop

**Key Innovation:** They discovered that open-source Llama-3.1-8B consistently outperformed the commercial GPT-3.5-Turbo, showing that smaller, open models can be more effective for specialized tasks.

### Technical Details

**Graph-Based Techniques:**
- **Homogeneous vs. Heterogeneous Graphs**: Despite theoretical advantages of using different node types, homogeneous graphs (treating all nodes the same) performed better
- **Graph Attention Networks**: Two-layer GAT architecture for information aggregation
- **Multi-relational Edges**: Three distinct relationship types in the graph
- **Residual Connections**: Preserve original node information after graph convolution

**Mathematical Formulations:**
**Contrastive Loss Detail:**
```
L_contrastive = -log(exp(sim(q,p)/τ) / (Σ exp(sim(q,n)/τ)))
```
Where:
- q = query case
- p = positive (relevant) case
- n = negative (irrelevant) cases
- τ = temperature parameter
- sim = similarity function

**Regularization Loss:**
```
L_regularization = Σ ||A_pseudo[i,:]||_2^2
```

**Algorithms:**
1. Graph construction using BM25 for initial edges
2. GAT layers for node embedding updates
3. Pseudo-adjacency matrix learning
4. Contrastive learning for similarity optimization

## 2. Efficient Recommendation with Millions of Items by Dynamic Pruning

### Main Institution
Not explicitly identified in available sources (Author: Aleksandr V. Petrov with 2 co-authors)

### Feynman Explanation

Imagine you run an online store with **millions of products**. When a customer visits, you need to recommend the best products instantly. Checking all millions is too slow - this paper solves that with a "smart shortcut."

**The Core Innovation - RecJPQPrune:**
Instead of storing one big description for each product (like a full encyclopedia entry), RecJPQ breaks each item into smaller pieces - like describing a car by its engine, wheels, color separately. RecJPQPrune adds intelligence to stop searching when it knows it has found the best items.

**How It Works:**
1. **Sub-Item Embeddings**: Each item is split into multiple small descriptions
```
Item_embedding = concatenate(sub_embedding_1, sub_embedding_2, ..., sub_embedding_n)
```

2. **Dynamic Pruning Algorithm**:
```
1. Initialize: best_K_scores = []
2. For each item in catalog:
   a. Calculate upper_bound_score for remaining items
   b. If upper_bound_score < min(best_K_scores):
      STOP (safe to skip remaining items)
   c. Otherwise, calculate actual score
   d. Update best_K_scores if needed
```

**The Mathematical Guarantee:**
The system is "safe-up-to-rank K" - it mathematically guarantees no top-K item is missed while avoiding unnecessary calculations.

### Technical Questions Answered

**Is RecJPQPrune not scoring the entire catalog?**
**Correct!** The key innovation is that it stops early when mathematically proven safe, avoiding scoring millions of unnecessary items.

**Do they define an upper bound and stop adding scores below threshold?**
**Yes!** The algorithm calculates upper bounds for remaining items and stops when these bounds fall below the K-th best score found.

**RQ1: Effect on score efficiency - is it faster?**
**Dramatically faster:**
- **64x speedup** on Tmall dataset (2.2M items)
- 5.3x faster than previous PQTopK approach
- Can score 2 million items in under 10 milliseconds without GPUs

**RQ2: What's the cutoff effect?**
The cutoff dramatically reduces computational load while maintaining perfect accuracy through the "safe-up-to-rank K" guarantee.

**Is the final score a sum of chunks?**
**Yes!** Sub-item embeddings are processed in chunks, and the final item score combines scores from all sub-item chunks.

**Technical Details:**
- Based on Product Quantization for embedding compression
- Processes sub-items incrementally with running upper bounds
- Achieves catalog scales "not previously reported in literature"

## 3. CAFE+: Towards Compact, Adaptive, and Fast Embedding

### Main Institution
**Peking University** - School of Computer Science

### Feynman Explanation

Think of CAFE+ like a **smart library system** for recommendation models. Important books (hot features) get private shelves (unique embeddings), while less important books share shelves (hash embeddings). The librarian (HotSketch) constantly monitors which books are popular and reorganizes accordingly.

**Three-Tier Architecture:**
1. **HotSketch Structure**: A lightweight "popularity tracker" that identifies important features in real-time
2. **Unique Embedding Table**: Private storage for hot features
3. **Multi-level Hash Tables**: Shared storage for less important features

**Mathematical Foundation:**
**Optimization Problem:**
```
min L(θ_E^c, θ_N; P_t) subject to M(θ_E^c) ≤ M_budget
```
Where:
- θ_E^c = compressed embedding table
- θ_N = neural network parameters
- P_t = shifting data distribution at time t
- M(·) = memory usage function

**Feature Importance Score:**
```
Importance(f_i) = ||∇_θ_E[f_i] L||_2
```
(The L2-norm of gradients tells us how much each feature affects the model)

### Technical Questions Answered

**Hash-based Methods:**
CAFE+ uses sophisticated **multi-level hash embedding**:
1. **Compositional Hash Functions**: Multiple hash functions reduce collisions
2. **Quotient-Remainder Trick**: Better distribution through complementary partitioning
```
h_1(x) = x mod p_1
h_2(x) = ⌊x/p_1⌋ mod p_2
Final_embedding = Table_1[h_1(x)] + Table_2[h_2(x)]
```
3. **Consistent Hashing**: Smooth transitions during feature migration

**Adaptive Methods:**
Real-time adaptivity through:
1. **Dynamic Feature Tracking**: HotSketch monitors feature importance via gradient norms
2. **Threshold-based Migration**: Features automatically move between tables based on importance
3. **Distribution Shift Handling**: Periodic score decay adapts to changing patterns
4. **Memory Reallocation**: Dynamic adjustment between hot and non-hot features

**Mixed Embedding Types?**
**Yes, extensively:**
- **Type 1 - Unique Embeddings**: For hot features (~10% of features)
- **Type 2 - Dual Hash Embeddings**: For medium features (lookup 2 tables, sum results)
- **Type 3 - Single Hash Embeddings**: For cold features

**Offline vs Online Training Differences:**

**Offline Training:**
- All data collected in advance
- Static feature importance distribution
- Batch processing in epochs
- Can use distributed systems
- Frequency-based importance possible

**Online Training:**
- Streaming real-time data
- Dynamic importance changes (significant KL divergence shown)
- Must process and serve simultaneously
- Stricter memory limits
- Requires HotSketch for real-time tracking

**Key Innovation:** Online training requires the HotSketch structure for real-time importance tracking, while offline could use pre-computed statistics.

## 4. Pre-training for Recommendation Unlearning

### Main Institution
Likely **University of Hong Kong** based on authorship patterns (Chao Huang's research group)

### Feynman Explanation

Imagine a social network where you want to "unfriend" someone. Simply removing the connection isn't enough - you need to remove all the indirect influences that friendship had on your other connections and recommendations. That's what **UnlearnRec** does for recommendation models.

**The Core Problem:**
When users request data deletion (privacy laws) or change preferences, traditional methods either:
- Retrain the entire model (too expensive)
- Fragment the graph (damages structure)

**UnlearnRec Solution:**
1. **Influence Encoder**: Takes unlearning requests and current model parameters
2. **Parameter Generation**: Directly produces updated parameters with influence removed
3. **Minimal Fine-tuning**: Preserves performance while removing specific influences

### Technical Questions Answered

**Is it removing user-specific info from recommendation models?**
**Yes!** The method specifically targets user-specific information removal:
- Eliminates specific user-item interactions
- Removes user data influence for privacy compliance
- Handles preference change requests
- Mitigates ripple effects in the graph

**For privacy and what other cases?**
1. **Privacy Protection**: GDPR/CCPA compliance ("right to be forgotten")
2. **Preference Management**: Users changing interests, correcting biases
3. **System Maintenance**: Removing spam/malicious interactions, cleaning corrupted data
4. **Business Applications**: Content removal, seasonal adjustments, A/B testing cleanup

**Is it about removing learnings in Graph (GNN)?**
**Yes, specifically for GNN-based recommendations:**
- **GNN-Specific Challenges**:
  - Graph structure preservation crucial
  - Influence propagation through multiple layers
  - Complex parameter dependencies
- **Solutions**:
  - Structure-preserving unlearning
  - Direct parameter manipulation
  - Model-agnostic approach (works with GraphSAGE, GCN, etc.)
- **Performance**: 10x speedup vs. retraining

**Technical Innovation:** Maintains graph connectivity while removing influence - like carefully rewiring a web to remove a spider without breaking the structure.

## 5. Data-efficient Meta-models for Evaluation of Context-based Questions and Answers in LLMs

### Main Institution
**Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (MIPT)** and **Sber AI Laboratory**

### Feynman Explanation

Think of hallucination detection like having a **lie detector for AI systems**. When an AI answers a question, it might make up plausible-sounding information not supported by the given context. This system detects such fabrications.

**Two-Stage Pipeline:**
1. **Feature Extraction**: An "extractor LLM" pulls out internal representations
2. **Meta-Classification**: Lightweight classifiers make final predictions

**Feature Extraction Methods:**
- **Pooling-based Features**: 
  - Mean pooling (averaging all tokens)
  - Max pooling (taking maximum values)
  - Last token extraction
- **Lookback Lens Features**: Attention weight ratios between context and generated tokens

**Mathematical Formulation:**
Lookback ratio = mean attention weight between context and generated tokens across all layers/heads

For efficiency, they use PCA/UMAP to compress features to 30 components each (staying under TabPFNv2's 500-feature limit).

### Technical Questions Answered

**Benchmarks Used:**
1. **RAGTruth** (Niu et al., 2023): Human-annotated dataset with expert-curated labels
2. **ExpertQA** (Malaviya et al., 2023): Expert-level questions with attributed answers
3. **EManual** (Nandy et al., 2021): Technical documentation Q&A dataset

**Evaluation Metrics:**
- **ROC-AUC**: Primary metric (0.7834 achieved)
- **Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)**: Ranking quality measure

**Data Efficiency Achievement:**
- TabPFNv2 excels with just **250 samples**
- Performance plateaus at this point
- Makes deployment practical for resource-constrained environments

**Architecture:**
```
Input: [CLS] query [SEP] item_title [SEP] product_type [SEP] brand [SEP] color [SEP] gender [SEP]
```
- Base: Walmart's in-house BERT-Base (110M parameters)
- Teacher: 7B parameter LLMs (Llama2-7B, Mistral-7B)
- Output: Single relevance score (0-1)

### Technical Questions Answered

- Reformulated as binary with soft labels (0, 0.5, 1)
- Cross-encoder scores feed downstream ranking model

**Do they mix query with items' metadata for cross encoder?**
**Yes!** Input concatenates:
- Query
- Item title
- Product type
- Brand
- Color
- Gender
- Description (teacher only - excluded from student for latency)

**Do they use MLM on query or items' property?**
No explicit MLM during inference. Base BERT was pre-trained with MLM, but fine-tuning focuses on relevance prediction.

**What is Query-Item Key value store?**
While not explicitly named, they have:
- **Query Signals**: Precomputed scores for frequent query-item pairs
- **Caching System**: Stores feature scores to avoid real-time computation

**What are Product Tokens?**
Not explicitly defined, but based on context:
- **Separator Tokens**: [SEP] tokens between product attributes
- **Attribute Tokens**: Each attribute tokenized separately
- **CLS Token**: Used for final classification

**Mathematical Formulations:**
**Knowledge Distillation Loss:**
```
L_student(q) = Σ(i,j) [s_teacher(q,d_i) - s_teacher(q,d_j) - (s_student(q,d_i) - s_student(q,d_j))]²
```

**Results:**
- Student matches teacher performance at 60x smaller size
- +13.27% improvement in R@P=95%
- +0.8% ATC rate in production
