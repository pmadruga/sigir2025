| **INQUIRY ASSISTANT USING LLM-GENERATED KNOWLEDGE GRAPHS**<br>[Link](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3726302.3731956)                                  | Automates customer support by building knowledge graphs from help pages using LLMs, enabling the assistant to ask clarifying questions and provide more accurate responses than traditional retrieval-based bots.<br>Shows that this graph-led approach increases answer correctness and reduces hallucinations compared to retrieval-augmented generation.<br>Finds that turning unstructured help into structured knowledge enables more human-like, flexible dialog management and quicker customer resolutions. |
| **ALLEVIATING LLM-BASED GENERATIVE RETRIEVAL HALLUCINATION IN ALIPAY SEARCH**<br>[Link](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3726302.3731951)               | Tackles the issue of LLMs hallucinating in Alipay's product search by making document retrieval both reasoned and double-checked.<br>Combines knowledge-distillation (where small models learn reasoning from larger LLMs) with a "Decision Agent" that filters results via expert LLM evaluation.<br>Demonstrates significant improvements in search accuracy, user engagement, and business metrics, with automation and easy system integration.                                                                 |
| **MAAQR: AN LLM-BASED MULTI-AGENT FRAMEWORK FOR ADAPTIVE QUERY REWRITING IN ALIPAY SEARCH**<br>[Link](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3726302.3731950) | Solves search failure from lexical gaps between user queries and system content by using LLMs fine-tuned with pseudo-data and a multi-agent system for query rewriting.<br>Each agent specializes (relevance, intent, keyword adaptation, user-behavior) and a decision mechanism picks rewrites that maximize actual user impact.<br>Results in more relevant results, higher engagement, and rapid adaptation to changing vocabulary or new apps on the platform.                                                 |
| **EXAMPLES AS THE PROMPT: A SCALABLE APPROACH FOR EFFICIENT LLM ADAPTATION IN E-COMMERCE**<br>[Link](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3726302.3731941)  | Addresses the cost and rigidity of manual LLM prompt engineering for new e-commerce tasks by automating example selection from real labeled data ("Examples as the Prompt", EaP).<br>Combines global and local examples to maximize model accuracy and adaptability.<br>An optimized version, EaPlite, removes natural language instructions for faster inference, achieving similar or better results than expert-crafted prompts while reducing operational overhead.                                             |
