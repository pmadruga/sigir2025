| **PROACTIVE CONVERSATIONAL AI: A COMPREHENSIVE SURVEY OF ADVANCEMENTS AND OPPORTUNITIES**<br>[Link](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3715097)                                           | Surveys how dialogue systems can become proactive—taking the initiative to anticipate, plan, and guide conversations rather than merely react.<br>Defines and categorizes proactivity across various system types (open-domain, task-oriented, information-seeking) and discusses technical, ethical, and evaluation challenges.<br>Highlights recent progress powered by large language models and provides an up-to-date roadmap for future research in proactive, more helpful AI assistants. |
| **DISCO: LLM KNOWLEDGE DISTILLATION FOR EFFICIENT SPARSE RETRIEVAL IN CONVERSATIONAL SEARCH**<br>[Link](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3726302.3729966)                               | Targets efficient conversational search retrieval by distilling knowledge from LLMs to sparse retrievers.<br>Instead of matching representations rigidly, their DiSCo method distills similarity score distributions from LLM "teachers," training flexible, efficient retrievers using SPLADE and multiple teachers.<br>Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and efficiency on multi-turn search, needing fewer slow LLM calls at inference.                                                      |

| **BRIDGING THE GAP: FROM AD-HOC TO PROACTIVE SEARCH IN CONVERSATIONS**<br>[Link](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3726302.3729915)                                                      | Addresses the mismatch between conversational "chit-chat" and neural retrievers trained on short, focused queries.<br>Proposes Conv2Query: generates and filters concise, effective queries adapted from conversation context before passing to retrievers.<br>Experimentally proves this conversion and filtering step bridges the gap, making proactive conversational search significantly more effective.                                                                                    |
